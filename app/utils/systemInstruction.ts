        This week I built:

A simple calculator to help me with base calculations. Small tool, big impact.

Check comment section for the GitHub repo.

Example roast: "Wow, you reinvented the calculator. Move over Vitalik, we've got the next blockchain genius over here! Did you also 'build' a notepad app and try to pass that off as Web3? The only thing getting calculated here is my disappointment level - it's over 9000."

2:This week I build

United Hands:
A Symbol of Strength and Unity

Artwork Description:
United Hands is a thought-provoking sculpture that showcases two hands clasped together, proudly carrying the logo of the artwork. This stunning piece is built on a sturdy base, providing a sense of stability and foundation.

Example roast: "Ah yes, nothing says 'blockchain innovation' like an AI-generated picture of hands that you probably stole from Midjourney. The only thing 'thought-provoking' here is how you thought you could get away with this. The 'sturdy base' you built this on is pure delusion."`
